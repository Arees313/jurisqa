    "question": "On whom is Khoms obligatory, is it obligatory on the fuqara (poor) and masakeen (destitute) and who are the fuqara and masakeen?",
    "answer": "It is obligatory on every mukalif (person with religious accountability) just like fasting and prayers (Salat). The resources and circumstances that make Khoms obligatory exist within the book of Sharaye3 (Legislation of Islam). Jawab Al Muneer volume 2. Imam Ahmed Alhasan said: \"Khoms is obligatory in everything that is surplus from the need of the person when it reaches its Khoms Year. Khoms is an act of worship just as fasting and praying and it is the reason for the purity and clearness of the soul, (swt) said: 'Take, from their money a charity by which you purify them and cause them increase, and invoke [Allah's blessings] upon them. Indeed, your invocations are reassurance for them. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing.' [Tawba:113]. It is not important whether the amount was small or big for perhaps a Dirham from a person who owns five Dirhams is more rewarding for Allah than the thousand paid by who owns 5 thousand. In general, the Khoms and Zakat is the reason for the increase in wealth as the believer doesn't know that perhaps paying off his Khoms or charity would be the reason for Allah to increase his wealth. Every Mukallaf must determine a day of the year in which he puts himself into account and pay off the fifth of his money. For example, someone who collected money for marriage and didn't spend it until a year has passed, must pay its fifth. You can read the book of (a letter in the jurisprudence of fiqh p.20).

    "question": "What are the conditions that invalidate ablution?",
    "answer": "There are six conditions (ahdath) that invalidate ablution: 1. Discharge of urine, excrement, and passing wind from the usual place. If the excrement comes out from the small intestines, it does not break ablution. If it comes from the large intestines, it does. 2. If the makhraj (outlet) is not in the usual place and discharges excrement, it breaks ablution. The same rule applies if it becomes a habitual outlet due to injury. 3. Sleep that overtakes the senses invalidates ablution. This includes fainting, madness, intoxication, and minor menstruation (istihādah). 4. Discharge of madhy, wadhy (waddy), or blood — even from the two outlets — does not invalidate ablution, except for the three types of blood: haydh (menstruation), nifās (postnatal bleeding), and istihādah. 5. Vomiting, mucus (nukhamah), nail cutting, hair shaving, or touching private parts, the buttocks, or a strange woman do not invalidate ablution. 6. Eating food touched by fire, or anything exiting the two outlets unless mixed with impurities, does not invalidate ablution.",

    "answer": "Adhan and Iqamah are obligatory for the five daily obligatory prayers, whether performed late (ada) or as make-up prayers (qadha), and whether prayed singly or in congregation. Women should recite them quietly. Adhan is not valid for Nafila (voluntary) prayers, but the caller says 'Al-Salat' three times. For make-up prayers, Adhan and Iqamah should be done for each prayer, though making Adhan once and Iqamah for the rest is less preferred. On Fridays, Adhan and Iqamah are for Dhuhr, and only Iqamah for Asr. If the imam finishes congregational prayer and others arrive, they should not make Adhan/Iqamah unless the rows disperse. If a person intends to pray alone but joins a group, he should repeat Adhan and Iqamah. The caller (Mu'adhin) must be a sane Muslim male; puberty is not required but maturity (mumayyiz) is recommended. It is recommended he be just, have a pleasant voice, know prayer times, be pure, and stand in a high place. Women's Adhan for women is valid. A person praying alone without Adhan should continue. Mu'adhins receive payment from the treasury if no volunteers are found. Adhan consists of several parts said twice each: Takbir (Allahu Akbar) four times; testimonies of faith and guardianship of Ali and the Imams; calls to prayer and success; concluding with Takbir and Tahlil. Iqamah is similar but shorter, adding 'Qad Qamat As-Salat' twice and Tahlil once. Correct order and recommended etiquettes (facing Qiblah, pauses, deliberate recitation, etc.) apply. Tarji (repeating) in Adhan is disliked except for spreading the call. Saying 'Salat is better than sleep' is forbidden. Rules include: repeating Adhan/Iqamah if one wakes from sleep or fainting; valid Adhan even if caller apostatizes afterward; repeating if apostasy occurs during Adhan; listeners recommended to silently repeat; strong dislike for speech when 'Qad Qamat As-Salat' is said except for managing rows; Mu'adhin must face Qiblah; preference for knowledgeable, pious callers; groups may call Adhan together; imams may accept Adhan from one praying alone; caller must renew Iqamah if ablution is lost; one praying behind an unsuitable imam may call Adhan/Iqamah for himself; and errors by the imam should be corrected by followers.",

    "question": "What are the rulings and recommended practices for Takfeen (shrouding the deceased)?",
    "answer": "It is wajib (obligatory) to use three pieces of cloth for kafan: the mi'zar (a loincloth from navel to knees), the qamis (covers from shoulders to shanks), and the izar (wrapper). In emergencies, one piece suffices. Silk kafan is impermissible. It is wajib to rub camphor on the seven parts of the body that touch the ground during prostration (masaajid), except for a person who dies in ihram, for whom camphor should not be used. The minimum camphor amount is one dirham, better four dirhams, and the ideal 13 and one-third dirhams. Burial without camphor is allowed if necessary. Only camphor and dharirah (fragments of scented cane from India) may be used for perfuming. It is recommended (sunan) that the washer (ghasil) performs ghusl or ablution before shrouding. The deceased should be clothed with an Ibri hibarah (a simple Yemeni dress), a cloth tied tightly around the thighs with cotton placed between the buttocks, and if needed, cotton inserted into the anal opening. A turban is wrapped around the head, its ends brought under the chin and over the chest. For women, additional lafaafa (wrapper) covers the breasts and a namat (woolen striped cloth) covers the body; a qina (head veil) replaces the turban. The kafan should be cotton sprinkled with dharirah on the hibarah, lafaafa, and qamis. Palm leaf stalks (or alternatives such as sidr or khilaf wood) are inserted on the right and left sides of the deceased. The kafan should be sewn with threads from itself, not moistened with saliva. Folding of the wrapper is done left over right and right over left. It is makruh (reprehensible) to use linen kafan, add sleeves, write in black ink on kafan, or place camphor inside ears or eyes.",

You can both complete the contract between each other and allow two witnesses to witness on your behalf or tell a number of people after you completed the contract; like invite some of those who you know for a banquet of food so that some people know about your marriage. And even if you completed the contract in a mosque that is Mukhalef(disagrees with you)in terms of purpose for approval or for some reason. You can redo your seega(statement)of the contract, if there was a certain Khalal(mishap). And the contract is sufficient if she says to you: (Zawajtoka nafsi bi mahr qadraho-katha-wa tathkor almaher) translation:(I made myself marry you by a dowry of this amount:such and such, and mention the dowry) . And there is no need for the existence of a third party to pronounce it; rather, there must be only two witnesses during the contract. If there wasn't this then after the contract make the contract known by telling it to a number of people that you were married with such and such[female], and you can make it known in any way you choose like a banquet at a wedding or publicize it or any form that is suitable for your situation.

And about the witnesses, it is required that they have what provides identification, from both spouses, like the ability to identify or having information which provides identification like the name and appearance and the same case is for Ish'har(publicizing/making the relationship become known). And these matters are usually available in the contract which is fulfilled between the husband and wife, whether its when they meet each other or in the community that they live in; because when people witness for them and they get publicized they will know the two spouses and can identify them, but if the contract was through means of communication from far like the phone or internet, it should be taken care of and ensured, that the information with everyone is enough for identification. And there is a matter which must be paid attention to which is: approving the marriage contract in writing is better than it being only by speech. So it is required to save the lineages and the rights and this becomes fulfilled in writing which is way better than if the contract and testimonies was by speech only.",

    "answer": "Thanks\nAnswer: The clothing is considered impure and it's mandatory to wash the part where it had contact with najasa(impurity)before Salat.\nJurisprudence Committee\nWhen wet clothes be contaminated on contact with the dog or pig, it is mandatory that the locality of contact be washed. If it be dry, it is mustahabb to sprinkle water on it. In case of wet contact with the body, it's to be washed.\nIf a person falls short of removing the najasah from his clothes or body, and begins the salat, he should repeat the salat whether it be in the appointed time or after the time of fard (obligatory) salat has passed. If he has not become aware of the najasah (during salat) and come to know after completing the salat, he will not have to repeat it at all.\nWhen he sees the najasah while performing the salat: if he can take off the (najis) dress and cover the private parts by another one, it is wajib on him to do so and continue the salat (which will be valid). If that act be not possible but with an act invalidating the salat, he should restart anew.\np.32-p.33 Sharaye Al-Islam\nAnd a vessel licked by a dog should be washed thrice, the first of which is through sand. And from wine and the rat if he died in it, thrice with water, 7 times is best. And what is other than that,(the vessel) gets washed once, other than the wash of removing - and three times is best.\npage 33 Sharaye Al-Islam",

    "answer": "Imam a.s was asked about Riba:\nQ90/ The Western (European) Banks: is it permissible to put a deposit there and take interest resulting from this deposit? Is it permissible to take a loan from them although it is with interest? And what if someone took the loan and didn’t want to pay it back, at times when he is not being able to and at other times when he is able?\nAnswer: There is no Riba [usury] with those; because they are neither Muslims nor believers, and it is permissible to take interest from them, and it is permissible to take loan from them with interest. It is not obligatory to repay the interest to them but it is obligatory to repay the loan to them as long as they are neither engaged in warfare nor Nawasib. And with the inability, there is no obligation to repay them until ability to repay is obtained.\nQ91/ Is it permissible to delude a non-Islamic bank and take out a loan from them, and then if he could return this amount to them he would, but what if he could not return it, what is the ruling?\nAnswer: In respect to transactions with banks that are owned by non-Muslims or owned by Nawasib who sets up hostility to the Imams or Mahdies, it is permissible to take from them loans with interest, or that you deposit your money with them and take interest from them, as there is no usury between the believer and non-Muslims, or between a believer and a one who sets up hostility (Nasibi). And if you have taken a loan from those and you were unable to repay there is no problem may Allah grant you success.\nAnswer: There is no problem in doing business with him unless you know that the money itself is unlawfully gained - then its not permissible to take it from him. In other words, if he gives you for example 1000 dinars and you know that the same 1000 dinars are unlawfully gained. However, if his money has haram(gains) there is no problem in doing business with him.",

According to the holy jurisprudence, how should the parents deal with a son or daughter who does not fast even if they are obligated to do so?\nA. Parents should introduce fasting to the young before puberty, and urge them to fulfill their obligations and avoid the forbidden, overseeing them until they are eighteen years of age.\nQ. How is puberty (which makes worship obligatory) defined?\nA. Puberty is defined by nocturnal (semen) emission, thick pubic hair, fourteen going on fifteen years of age for men, and nine going on ten years of age for women.\nQ. What is the verdict for the young girl who reaches puberty but does not follow the laws of fasting because of her young age, which may lead her to intentionally void the fast knowing of the verdict or not? And if she is grown up now, should she make up for the past with expiation? How many days should she make up and make expiation if she does not know how many days of voided fasting occurred?\nA. The mature person (post pubertal) who voids the fast purposely has to make up the voided days and make expiation22. If making up the days is neglected until the following Ramadan then it is an obligation to make an\nadditional expiation by giving a ration (¾ Kg) of food.

Furthermore, some of the perfumes are specialized with materials that sexually arouse.

    "answer": "Book of Commanding Good (Amr bil Maroof) and Forbidding evil (Nahi anil Munkar).\nMaroof: Any good deed that the lawgiver has commanded to do or guided towards.\nMunkar: And whatever the lawgiver has forbidden.\nAnd “Commanding The Good And Forbidding The Evil” is obligatory on every individual in the believing society.\nMaroof is divided into Obligatory and Recommended. Therefore, commanding to the Obligatory is obligatory, and commanding to the Mustahab (recommended) is recommended.\nAnd Munkar is not divided, so it is obligatory to forbid any Munkar.\nAnd the forbidding the Munkar does not become obligatory until four conditions are fulfilled:\nFirst: That the one who forbids knows that it (the action which he/she wants to forbid) is (actually) Munkar, so that he/she is safe from mistaking in forbidding it. And it is obligatory on every believer to learn (to know the Munkars, wrongs).\n2nd: He/she considers the forbidding to be effective. If overcomes by suspicion or realises that his/her forbidding will not be effective, then (it) does not become obligatory.\n3rd: The one who has done the Munkar, has persistence on its continuation. If signs of refusal become apparent from him/her from that Munkar, (then) the obligation gets void.\nFourth: That by his/her forbidding, harm ((فساد is not caused. So, whenever he/she suspects that by his/her prohibiting & forbidding he/she (own-self) may get harmed, or his/her property may get harmed, or one of believers may get harmed, (then) the obligation gets void.\nAnd the levels of Forbidding are 3.\n1st: Is (Forbidding) with heart, and it is like looking at the subject of Munkar with anger and turning away. And this forbidding with heart is an absolute Obligation. 2nd is (Forbidding) with tongue and 3rd is (Forbidding) with hands.\nAnd it is obligatory to remove the Munkar with heart in the first instance such that whenever he/she realises that the doer of Munkar will be disgusted by expression of hatred. If he/she realises that expression of hatred will not suffice, then turn away a little, and distancing (oneself) will suffice. And it is obligatory to turn-away and distance (oneself) and be sufficed with it.\nAnd if he/she realises that this method is also not sufficient, the Obligation of Forbidding with Heart transfers to Obligation to Verbal Forbidding, but in (following) order:\nFirst, he discusses gently, and then he removes a little gentleness according to requirement, and if this Munkar is not resolved except by hand, such as hitting and its likes, it is permissible to forbid him/her by hand. And if the prohibition requires wounding or killing, it is not permissible except with the permission of the Imam PBUH.\nAnd no one is allowed to execute the divine Hadood (Punishments), except the Imam (PBUH) if he is present, or those that Imam (PUBH) appoints to execute the Hadood. And in the absence of the Imam (PBUH), it is permissible for a Master to execute Hadd on his servant. And it is not permissible for a man to execute Hadd on his offspring and wife.\nAhmad a.s \nBook of Sharae Al Islam. Vol2. \nBook of Commanding Good (Maroof) and Forbidding evil (Munkar).",

    "answer": "First Rukn: About waters, which has several conditions.\nFirst condition: pure water (mutlaq).\nIt is everything deserving to be called water, without any addition. All\nof it is tahir (pure) and can be used for removing the hadath and khabath(i.e. urine, feces and others).\nHadath:\n[Al-Hadath al-akbar: It is what requires gusol(wash) like al-janaba, hayd(menses), istihada, nifas and others\nAl-Hadath al-asghar: It is what requires wudhu(ablution)]\nاي الحدث الاصغر والحدث الاکبر: اما الحدث الاصغر فهو الحدث الناقض للوضوء والذي يقع فيه المکلف احدها النوم والتبول وتبطل الصلاة بحدوثه ويرفع بالوضوء ، والحدث الاکبر فهو الحدث الاکبر يقع بالجماع والحيض وغيرها من الامور التي سيأتي تفصيلها والحدث الاکبر هو الذي يبطل الصوم به اذا بقی الشخص عمدا عليه بدون ان ی يغتسل ويبطل بحدوثه عند اعتکاف المکلف اذا بقي علیه دون ان یغتسل ، ويرفع الحدث الاکبر بالغسل .\nوالخبث : وهو النجاسة العارضة علی الجسم من احدی النجاسات کالبول والغائط وغيرها من النجاسات...ويرفع بالتطهير الموضعي وبعروضه علی الجسم وامره اذا وقع علی انسان انه لاينقض طهارة المتطهر من الحدثين .\nAs regards occurrence of najasah (impurity) in it, it is divided into: flowing (jari), mahqun (retained) and water of well.\nThe flowing water is that one which does not become najis unless through najasah affecting one of its qualities(color,smell, and taste) It can be purified by letting abundant water  on it-in an outpouring manner - till its change is removed. The same rule is applicable to bath water if it has a substance.\nIf it comes into contact with pure water that changes it, or it is changed by itself, it will remain -intact- as a purifier, as long as the name \"water\" continues to be used for it.\nIn regard of the mahqun (retained), that which is less than the kurr it becomes najis on contact with impurity. It is purified by letting a kurr or more to flow on it all at once, but it, apparently, is not purified by making it reach the quantity of kurr.\nWhen water reaches the extent of a kurr and more, nothing makes it najis, except that najasah affecting one of its qualities (smell, colour, taste).\nIt can be purified by letting a kurr after a kurr to flow on it till the (change)effect is removed. But it is never purified through removal of change (effect) by itself, or by blowing of the winds, or by falling of pure substances in it that remove the effect (change).\nA kurr is equal to (457 liters). Or that which each of its length, width and depth equals three and a half shibrs (i.e. between the height of the thumb to the height of the pinky) This rule is applicable to waters of puddles, pools, and vessels.\nRegarding well water, it becomes najis on contact with najasah if there is an amount less than kurr and its water comes to it by flowing. But if water comes to it through a spring that is connected to the substance of ground-water or its water was a kurr and above, it does not impurify unless one of its qualities change: color, taste, and smell. The way to purify it is by draining water from it by the measure of what went inside.\n1.The death of a bird or a chicken or that which is similar in size is: 10-100 liters in terms of the size of the animal and its situation. The scorpion, snake and gecko is between 30-70 liters in terms of the size of the animal and its situation.\n2.The death of a sheep or a dog or that which is similar in size is 100-460 liters in terms of the size of the animal and its situation\n3. The blood, urine, feces, semen, or intoxicant in it: 70-460 liters in terms of the amount that is inside and its situation. If the feces was a liquid or  is broken into pieces, 400 liters will be drained. If it was solidified and did not break into pieces, 100 liters will be drained after taking the feces out.\n4. The dead donkey, cow, or camel and the likes, are 460-700 liters in terms of the size of the animal and its situation.\n5. The dead human being, 700 liters will be drained.\nIf there remains in the water a color, taste, or smell from the animal breaking into pieces or blood, urine, wine and others - water will be drained from the well until the water becomes pure and the smell, color and taste disappears which came from the impurity.\nThree subsidiary issues:\nFirst: The ruling for the small human being in terms of draining water is like the ruling for the big human being.\nSecond: The differences in the types of impurities requires doubling of draining of water  even if doubling of draining water bore a resemblance.\nThird: If an animal \"the dog and that which is bigger in size\" or if it got peeled away in the well, all of its water shall be drained out. And if draining it out was not possible, the well will not become pure unless through alternating or pumping it from day to night - and that is best in regards to the dog and that which is smaller in size.\nIt is recommended that between the well and the manhole there shall be a distance of 5 arms length, if the ground was solid or if the well was on top of a manhole - and if it isn't like that then its 7 arms length. The well will not be ruled to be impure unless its known that the water of the manhole reached it. And if the water was ruled to be impure, it cannot be used for purity, in an absolute manner - neither can it be used for food or drinking unless out of necessity. If the impure vessel was confused to be pure, both of which need to be avoided. And if there wasn't any water but the water in them both, he shall perform tayammum.",

    "answer": "Al-Imam Ahmad Al-Hassan (as) was asked about the Financial and Economic System of the Al-Mahdi Nation What is the money used in the Country of Imam Mahdi (as) is it gold and silver or paper money as it exists in the world now? This question is about the tools of exchange for dealing with the value of production of goods and services in the State of Al-Mahdi. -May God bless you-not only on gold, silver and some types of high value metals and as other tools of value exchange, maybe even exchange value of stocks (securities) and government bonds and electronic money and other means which can be used to express the exchange of value of goods and services (exchange of value of production and value of labor wages), so that gold, silver and precious metals if they have been used to express the value of production requirements for exchange of certain values ​​for production of goods and services, The country of Al-Mahdi which will project what Allah SWT wills which will exceed the value of production of goods and services in various ways which will not only be subject (stalled) to gold, silver and securities (sham) which are generally accepted today. Yes, the journey of this blessed nation determines the conditions at certain periods that can induce them to operate certain mediums and intermediaries, but this does not mean stopping at the medium that handles the production value of goods and services, and what we need to know is justice comprehensive human beings, to be disseminated in the State of Al-Mahdi is a key practice in the dissemination of Justice and equity, and thus preventing the poverty of necessities of goods and services. In the State of Al-Mahdi or the State of Divine Justice, man's approach will be driven to be just, even if it is just what is in his Lord when he prostrates to Him with sincerity of worship and gratitude. Man will be just with the surrounding society when he loves others as he loves himself, that is, with the Divine morality that will be spread educated by Al-Mahdi with whom will produce a human society that will lead to the denial of material poverty after completing the elimination of spiritual poverty, and this will be implemented at the individual (personal) and community levels. A spiritually rich person will inevitably be materially rich with berpada (qanaah) which is a property that will not perish, will not run out and a spiritually rich society will inevitably fend off material poverty in its members who are socially and economically interdependent (ijtima3iy and Iqtishadiy).",

    "question": "On whom is Khoms obligatory, is it obligatory on the fuqara(poor) and masakeen(destitute) and who are the fuqara and masakeen?",
    "answer": "\nAnswer: It is obligatory on every mukalif(person with a religious accountability) just like fasting and prayers(Salat). And the resources and circumstances that make Khoms obligatory exist within the book of Sharaye3(Legislation of Islam). Jawab Al Muneer volume 2\nImam Ahmed Alhasan said:\n\"Khoms is obligatory in everything that is surplus from the need of the person when it reaches its Khoms Year. Khoms is an act of worship just as fasting and praying and it is the\nreason for the purity and clearness of the soul, (swt) said: \"Take, from their money a charity by which you purify them and cause them increase, and invoke [Allah 's blessings] upon them. Indeed, your invocations are reassurance for them. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing.\" [Tawba:113] .It is not important whether the amount was small or big for perhaps a Dirham from a person who owns five Dirhams is more rewarding for Allah than the thousand paid by who\nowns 5 thousand. In general, the Khoms and Zakat is the reason for the increase in wealth as the believer doesn't know that perhaps paying off his Khoms or charity would be the reason for Allah to increase his wealth.\"\n\"Every Mukallaf must determine a day of the year in which he puts himself into account and pay off the fifth of his money. As who collected money for marriage and he didn't spend it until a year has passed on it, he must pay its fifth.

There are vaccines with very low probabilities of harm, such as AstraZeneca, so it is better to take an alternative vaccine if available. If an alternate vaccine is not available and the person could be exposed or contract the virus, then it is better to take any available vaccine, whether it be AstraZeneca or a similar option. \nSide effects of the vaccine or drugs in general for this or any other pandemic-causing disease is expected and anticipated. However, it is not right for those who should take the vaccine to refrain from treatment or vaccination based on the argument of the potential harm to one in a million people; he is already in a situation of greater potential harm. \nAhmed Alhasan\nMay 3, 2021\n21st Ramadan 1442",

  "question": "Are huskies considered pure or unclean? Does their origin from wolves affect their purity? Is it permissible to keep dogs for play outside the house? How is something that comes into contact with a dog purified?",
  "answer": "In the name of Allah, the Abundantly Merciful, the Extremely Merciful.\n\nAll dogs are impure regardless of their origin. However, jurisprudence considers characteristics in classifying animals. Huskies, specifically, are not considered dogs in terms of impurity rulings and are treated like wolves. They may be kept, raised, and sold for legitimate purposes such as pulling sleighs or entertaining children. Verification of the animal being a pure husky should be based on its howl, tail shape, fur, or reliable breeder testimony.\n\nOwning dogs for mere play is not permissible unless they serve a reasonable purpose (e.g., guarding, guiding the blind, herding). Playing with such dogs is allowed. Breeders may sell useful dog species without needing to ask buyers about their intent.\n\nTouching a dry dog with a dry hand does not make one impure. Impurity transfers only through moisture. Purification of an affected area (excluding bowls) requires only water. Dogs may enter homes or vehicles, but contact with flowing moisture makes surfaces impure, though not transmissible to other items.",
