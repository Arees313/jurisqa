Imam Ahmed Alhasan said: \"Khoms is obligatory in everything that is surplus from the need of the person when it reaches its Khoms Year. Khoms is an act of worship just as fasting and praying and it is the reason for the purity and clearness of the soul, (swt) said: 'Take, from their money a charity by which you purify them and cause them increase, and invoke [Allah's blessings] upon them. Indeed, your invocations are reassurance for them. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing.' [Tawba:113]. It is not important whether the amount was small or big for perhaps a Dirham from a person who owns five Dirhams is more rewarding for Allah than the thousand paid by who owns 5 thousand. In general, the Khoms and Zakat is the reason for the increase in wealth as the believer doesn't know that perhaps paying off his Khoms or charity would be the reason for Allah to increase his wealth. Every Mukallaf must determine a day of the year in which he puts himself into account and pay off the fifth of his money. For example, someone who collected money for marriage and didn't spend it until a year has passed, must pay its fifth. You can read the book of (a letter in the jurisprudence of fiqh p.20).

Women should recite them quietly. Adhan is not valid for Nafila (voluntary) prayers, but the caller says 'Al-Salat' three times. For make-up prayers, Adhan and Iqamah should be done for each prayer, though making Adhan once and Iqamah for the rest is less preferred (but permissible). On Fridays, Adhan and Iqamah are for Dhuhr, and only Iqamah for Asr. If the imam finishes congregational prayer and others arrive, they should not make Adhan/Iqamah unless the rows disperse. If a person intends to pray alone but joins a group, he should repeat Adhan and Iqamah. The caller (Mu'adhin) must be a sane Muslim male; puberty is not required but maturity (mumayyiz) is recommended. It is recommended he be just, have a pleasant voice, know prayer times, be pure, and stand in a high place. Women's Adhan for women is valid. A person praying alone without Adhan should continue. Mu'adhins receive payment from the treasury if no volunteers are found. Adhan consists of several parts said twice each: Takbir (Allahu Akbar) four times; testimonies of faith and guardianship of Ali and the Imams; calls to prayer and success; concluding with Takbir and Tahlil. Iqamah is similar but shorter, adding 'Qad Qamat As-Salat' twice and Tahlil once. Correct order and recommended etiquettes (facing Qiblah, pauses, deliberate recitation, etc.) apply. Tarji (repeating) in Adhan is disliked except for spreading the call. Saying 'Salat is better than sleep' is forbidden. Rules include: repeating Adhan/Iqamah if one wakes from sleep or fainting; valid Adhan even if caller apostatizes afterward; repeating if apostasy occurs during Adhan; listeners recommended to silently repeat; strong dislike for speech when 'Qad Qamat As-Salat' is said except for managing rows; Mu'adhin must face Qiblah; preference for knowledgeable, pious callers; groups may call Adhan together; imams may accept Adhan from one praying alone; caller must renew Iqamah if ablution is lost; one praying behind an unsuitable imam may call Adhan/Iqamah for himself; and errors by the imam should be corrected by followers.",

Only camphor and dharirah (fragments of scented cane from India) may be used for perfuming. It is recommended (sunan) that the washer (ghasil) performs ghusl or ablution before shrouding. The deceased should be clothed with an Ibri hibarah (a simple Yemeni dress), a cloth tied tightly around the thighs with cotton placed between the buttocks, and if needed, cotton inserted into the anal opening. A turban is wrapped around the head, its ends brought under the chin and over the chest. For women, additional lafaafa (wrapper) covers the breasts and a namat (woolen striped cloth) covers the body; a qina (head veil) replaces the turban. The kafan should be cotton sprinkled with dharirah on the hibarah, lafaafa, and qamis. Palm leaf stalks (or alternatives such as sidr or khilaf wood) are inserted on the right and left sides of the deceased. The kafan should be sewn with threads from itself, not moistened with saliva. Folding of the wrapper is done left over right and right over left. It is makruh (reprehensible) to use linen kafan, add sleeves, write in black ink on kafan, or place camphor inside ears or eyes.",

If it be dry, it is mustahabb to sprinkle water on it. In case of wet contact with the body, it's to be washed.\nIf a person falls short of removing the najasah from his clothes or body, and begins the salat, he should repeat the salat whether it be in the appointed time or after the time of fard (obligatory) salat has passed. If he has not become aware of the najasah (during salat) and come to know after completing the salat, he will not have to repeat it at all.\nWhen he sees the najasah while performing the salat: if he can take off the (najis) dress and cover the private parts by another one, it is wajib on him to do so and continue the salat (which will be valid). If that act be not possible but with an act invalidating the salat, he should restart anew.\np.32-p.33 Sharaye Al-Islam\nAnd a vessel licked by a dog should be washed thrice, the first of which is through sand.

You can both complete the contract between each other and allow two witnesses to witness on your behalf or tell a number of people after you completed the contract; like invite some of those who you know for a banquet of food so that some people know about your marriage. And even if you completed the contract in a mosque that is Mukhalef(disagrees with you)in terms of purpose for approval or for some reason. You can redo your seega(statement)of the contract, if there was a certain Khalal(mishap).\nAnd the contract is sufficient if she says to you: (Zawajtoka nafsi bi mahr qadraho-katha-wa tathkor almaher) translation:(I made myself marry you by a dowry of this amount:such and such, and mention the dowry) . And there is no need for the existence of a third party to pronounce it; rather, there must be only two witnesses during the contract. If there wasn't this then after the contract make the contract known by telling it to a number of people that you were married with such and such[female], and you can make it known in any way you choose like a banquet at a wedding or publicize it or any form that is suitable for your situation.\nSalam Alaikom Warahmatullah Wabarakatu\nAhmed AlHasan\nQuestion 435 Jawab AlMuneer",

Is it permissible to take a loan from them although it is with interest? And what if someone took the loan and didn’t want to pay it back, at times when he is not being able to and at other times when he is able?\nAnswer: There is no Riba [usury] with those; because they are neither Muslims nor believers, and it is permissible to take interest from them, and it is permissible to take loan from them with interest. It is not obligatory to repay the interest to them but it is obligatory to repay the loan to them as long as they are neither engaged in warfare nor Nawasib. And with the inability, there is no obligation to repay them until ability to repay is obtained.\nQ91/ Is it permissible to delude a non-Islamic bank and take out a loan from them, and then if he could return this amount to them he would, but what if he could not return it, what is the ruling?\nAnswer: In respect to transactions with banks that are owned by non-Muslims or owned by Nawasib who sets up hostility to the Imams or Mahdies, it is permissible to take from them loans with interest, or that you deposit your money with them and take interest from them, as there is no usury between the believer and non-Muslims, or between a believer and a one who sets up hostility (Nasibi). And if you have taken a loan from those and you were unable to repay there is no problem may Allah grant you success.\nAnswer: There is no problem in doing business with him unless you know that the money itself is unlawfully gained - then its not permissible to take it from him. In other words, if he gives you for example 1000 dinars and you know that the same 1000 dinars are unlawfully gained.

Therefore, commanding to the Obligatory is obligatory, and commanding to the Mustahab (recommended) is recommended.\nAnd Munkar is not divided, so it is obligatory to forbid any Munkar.\nAnd the forbidding the Munkar does not become obligatory until four conditions are fulfilled:\nFirst: That the one who forbids knows that it (the action which he/she wants to forbid) is (actually) Munkar, so that he/she is safe from mistaking in forbidding it. And it is obligatory on every believer to learn (to know the Munkars, wrongs).\n2nd: He/she considers the forbidding to be effective.

If signs of refusal become apparent from him/her from that Munkar, (then) the obligation gets void.\nFourth: That by his/her forbidding, harm ((فساد is not caused.

If he/she realises that expression of hatred will not suffice, then turn away a little, and distancing (oneself) will suffice. And it is obligatory to turn-away and distance (oneself) and be sufficed with it.\nAnd if he/she realises that this method is also not sufficient, the Obligation of Forbidding with Heart transfers to Obligation to Verbal Forbidding, but in (following) order:\nFirst, he discusses gently, and then he removes a little gentleness according to requirement, and if this Munkar is not resolved except by hand, such as hitting and its likes, it is permissible to forbid him/her by hand.

All\nof it is tahir (pure) and can be used for removing the hadath and khabath(i.e. urine, feces and others).\nHadath:\n[Al-Hadath al-akbar: It is what requires gusol(wash) like al-janaba, hayd(menses), istihada, nifas and others\nAl-Hadath al-asghar: It is what requires wudhu(ablution)]\nاي الحدث الاصغر والحدث الاکبر: اما الحدث الاصغر فهو الحدث الناقض للوضوء والذي يقع فيه المکلف احدها النوم والتبول وتبطل الصلاة بحدوثه ويرفع بالوضوء ، والحدث الاکبر فهو الحدث الاکبر يقع بالجماع والحيض وغيرها من الامور التي سيأتي تفصيلها والحدث الاکبر هو الذي يبطل الصوم به اذا بقی الشخص عمدا عليه بدون ان ی يغتسل ويبطل بحدوثه عند اعتکاف المکلف اذا بقي علیه دون ان یغتسل ، ويرفع الحدث الاکبر بالغسل .\nوالخبث : وهو النجاسة العارضة علی الجسم من احدی النجاسات کالبول والغائط وغيرها من النجاسات...ويرفع بالتطهير الموضعي وبعروضه علی الجسم وامره اذا وقع علی انسان انه لاينقض طهارة المتطهر من الحدثين .\nAs regards occurrence of najasah (impurity) in it, it is divided into: flowing (jari), mahqun (retained) and water of well.\nThe flowing water is that one which does not become najis unless through najasah affecting one of its qualities(color,smell, and taste) It can be purified by letting abundant water  on it-in an outpouring manner - till its change is removed. The same rule is applicable to bath water if it has a substance.\nIf it comes into contact with pure water that changes it, or it is changed by itself, it will remain -intact- as a purifier, as long as the name \"water\" continues to be used for it.\nIn regard of the mahqun (retained), that which is less than the kurr it becomes najis on contact with impurity. It is purified by letting a kurr or more to flow on it all at once, but it, apparently, is not purified by making it reach the quantity of kurr.\nWhen water reaches the extent of a kurr and more, nothing makes it najis, except that najasah affecting one of its qualities (smell, colour, taste).\nIt can be purified by letting a kurr after a kurr to flow on it till the (change)effect is removed. But it is never purified through removal of change (effect) by itself, or by blowing of the winds, or by falling of pure substances in it that remove the effect (change).\nA kurr is equal to (457 liters). Or that which each of its length, width and depth equals three and a half shibrs (i.e. between the height of the thumb to the height of the pinky) This rule is applicable to waters of puddles, pools, and vessels.\nRegarding well water, it becomes najis on contact with najasah if there is an amount less than kurr and its water comes to it by flowing. But if water comes to it through a spring that is connected to the substance of ground-water or its water was a kurr and above, it does not impurify unless one of its qualities change: color, taste, and smell. The way to purify it is by draining water from it by the measure of what went inside.\n1.The death of a bird or a chicken or that which is similar in size is: 10-100 liters in terms of the size of the animal and its situation. The scorpion, snake and gecko is between 30-70 liters in terms of the size of the animal and its situation.\n2.The death of a sheep or a dog or that which is similar in size is 100-460 liters in terms of the size of the animal and its situation\n3. The blood, urine, feces, semen, or intoxicant in it: 70-460 liters in terms of the amount that is inside and its situation. If the feces was a liquid or  is broken into pieces, 400 liters will be drained. If it was solidified and did not break into pieces, 100 liters will be drained after taking the feces out.\n4. The dead donkey, cow, or camel and the likes, are 460-700 liters in terms of the size of the animal and its situation.\n5. The dead human being, 700 liters will be drained.\nIf there remains in the water a color, taste, or smell from the animal breaking into pieces or blood, urine, wine and others - water will be drained from the well until the water becomes pure and the smell, color and taste disappears which came from the impurity.\nThree subsidiary issues:\nFirst: The ruling for the small human being in terms of draining water is like the ruling for the big human being.\nSecond: The differences in the types of impurities requires doubling of draining of water  even if doubling of draining water bore a resemblance.\nThird: If an animal \"the dog and that which is bigger in size\" or if it got peeled away in the well, all of its water shall be drained out. And if draining it out was not possible, the well will not become pure unless through alternating or pumping it from day to night - and that is best in regards to the dog and that which is smaller in size.\nIt is recommended that between the well and the manhole there shall be a distance of 5 arms length, if the ground was solid or if the well was on top of a manhole - and if it isn't like that then its 7 arms length. The well will not be ruled to be impure unless its known that the water of the manhole reached it. And if the water was ruled to be impure, it cannot be used for purity, in an absolute manner - neither can it be used for food or drinking unless out of necessity. If the impure vessel was confused to be pure, both of which need to be avoided. And if there wasn't any water but the water in them both, he shall perform tayammum.",

And the resources and circumstances that make Khoms obligatory exist within the book of Sharaye3(Legislation of Islam). Jawab Al Muneer volume 2\nImam Ahmed Alhasan said:\n\"Khoms is obligatory in everything that is surplus from the need of the person when it reaches its Khoms Year. Khoms is an act of worship just as fasting and praying and it is the\nreason for the purity and clearness of the soul, (swt) said: \"Take, from their money a charity by which you purify them and cause them increase, and invoke [Allah 's blessings] upon them. Indeed, your invocations are reassurance for them. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing.\" [Tawba:113] .It is not important whether the amount was small or big for perhaps a Dirham from a person who owns five Dirhams is more rewarding for Allah than the thousand paid by who\nowns 5 thousand. In general, the Khoms and Zakat is the reason for the increase in wealth as the believer doesn't know that perhaps paying off his Khoms or charity would be the reason for Allah to increase his wealth.\"\n\"Every Mukallaf must determine a day of the year in which he puts himself into account and pay off the fifth of his money. As who collected money for marriage and he didn't spend it until a year has passed on it, he must pay its fifth.

A believer wanted to marry another believer and they were satisfied with one another, but the Istikharah turned out to be negative, so they decided to leave the matter alone. Actually, the situation has made me wonder a lot, as it is always said to perform Istikharah when confused. In this situation, were they wrong, was the Istikhara improperly performed, was it correct—do we even perform Istikhaarah in such cases? Answer from Ahmed Alhasan احمد الحسن: May the peace, mercy, and blessing of God be upon you. May God welcome you. Istikhara is for [cases of] differing paths, confusion, and for not knowing the appropriate or correct path. In the case of a man who would like to marry a woman or a woman who would like to marry a man, istikhara is meaningless, as it depends on examining the matter, and on it being suitable and correct for both of them.",

Sender: Adnan Al Mahdi. Answer: In the Name of God the Abundantly Merciful and Intensely Merciful. Prayers of God be upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad the Imams and Mahdis Wasalem Tasleema. It is not obligatory for the woman to cover the face, two hands or feet, but, it is obligatory for her to cover anything other than what was mentioned with a true covering. Meaning that the clothes shouldn't be soft or tight which describes what is under it. If the woman was wearing jeans and over it she is wearing a jubba or covering that is extended until the two knees and whatever appeared from it is not tightened whereby it doesn't describe what is under it then there is no problem with that. Rather, perhaps sometimes it is more concealing for the woman. But if the woman is wearing jeans and there is nothing over it while she is wearing a hijab, this is not right and is not considered an Islamic hijab. Rather, exposing herself in this way is greater than revealing her hair and head.",

Answer: If he returned and the distance (to shorten prayers) was complete and increased over (the said distance) he shall shorten his prayers, and if he didn't he won't. In the above example(whoever traveled the distance on his return, 24 kms) he will not shorten his prayers.

Does this invalidate her fast, and what are the consequences for the perpetrator? Answer: In the Name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Prayers and peace be upon Muhammad and his purified progeny. Regarding this grave matter, the ruling is as follows: If a man forced himself upon a stranger (woman) meaning he raped her, her fasting remains correct and valid. There is no kafara (expiation) nor making up (the fasting) required from her. However, the perpetrator bears severe consequences - kafara and making up (the fasting) are obligatory upon him. Furthermore, he is to be executed for this crime, tortured in his killing, and struck with a sword on his face as punishment.

Answer: In the Name of Allah the Abundantly Merciful and Intensely Merciful. Praise due to Allah the Lord of the Worlds, Prayers of Allah be upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad the Imams and Mahdis Wasalem Tasleema. If Allah chose for you, the khair is what Allah chose, the Exalted. As for the contract may Allah grant you success. You can both complete the contract between each other and allow two witnesses to witness on your behalf or tell a number of people after you completed the contract; like invite some of those who you know for a banquet of food so that some people know about your marriage. And even if you completed the contract in a mosque that is Mukhalef(disagrees with you)in terms of purpose for approval or for some reason. You can redo your seega(statement)of the contract, if there was a certain Khalal(mishap). And the contract is sufficient if she says to you: (Zawajtoka nafsi bi mahr qadraho-katha-wa tathkor almaher) translation:(I made myself marry you by a dowry of this amount:such and such, and mention the dowry) . And there is no need for the existence of a third party to pronounce it; rather, there must be only two witnesses during the contract. If there wasn't this then after the contract make the contract known by telling it to a number of people that you were married with such and such[female], and you can make it known in any way you choose like a banquet at a wedding or publicize it or any form that is suitable for your situation.

And that the witnesses and the husband and wife are in a private room and then the contract becomes consummated? Answer: It is allowed if there was a complete identification both from the husband and wife for their mates, whether appearance or name or any form of identification which distinguishes the human being with others of his or her own gender. And about the witnesses, it is required that they have what provides identification, from both spouses, like the ability to identify or having information which provides identification like the name and appearance and the same case is for Ish'har(publicizing/making the relationship become known). And these matters are usually available in the contract which is fulfilled between the husband and wife, whether its when they meet each other or in the community that they live in; because when people witness for them and they get publicized they will know the two spouses and can identify them, but if the contract was through means of communication from far like the phone or internet, it should be taken care of and ensured, that the information with everyone is enough for identification. And there is a matter which must be paid attention to which is: approving the marriage contract in writing is better than it being only by speech.

What are the rulings for cases of doubt between 2-3 rak'ahs, 3-4 rak'ahs, 2-4 rak'ahs, or 2-3-4 rak'ahs? Answer: As for doubt in prayer considering the number of Rakaat there are matters: The first: Whoever doubts in the number of Rakaat in the obligatory prayers which contains 2 Rakaat, he repeats; like Subh, Prayer of Safar (traveling), Prayer of Eideen (2 Eids) which are obligatory, Kusuf (prayer of Eclipse), as well as Maghrib. Second: If he doubts [the number of Rakaat] in the four Rakaat prayer, if he was in the first two [Rakaat], he repeats , as well as if he did not know how many [Rakaat] he prayed. And if he was certain about the two first [Rakaat] (meaning if he was certain that he completed two first Rakkat) and was in doubt about the rest. he must work by precaution: And its matters are four (meaning the matters of precaution): 1. Whoever doubts between the two [Rakaat] and the three [Rakaat] works by the three (meaning whoever is in doubt whether he prayed 2 or 3 Rakaat), finishes/completes, and makes tashahud and tasleem, then he continuous by praying one Rakaa standing, or two Rakaat sitting. 2. Whoever doubts between the three and the four, works by the four, he makes Tashahud and Tasleem and be cautious as the first [to pray one Rakaa standing or two Rakaat sitting]. 3. Whoever doubts between the two and the four (Rakaat), works by the four, makes Tashahud and Tasleem, and then pray two Rakaat standing. 4. Whoever doubts between the two, the tree and the four, works by the four, makes Tashahud and Tasleem, and then prays two Rakaat standing and two Rakaat sitting. And the best in all these images and others is that he works by the least/less, so if it was less than four he completes his prayer, makes Tasleem and performs the two Sajdas of Forgetfulness, and if it was four he makes Tasleem and performs the two Sajdas of Forgetfulness, and if he was on the fourth [Rakaa] he completes it, makes Tasleem, and performs the two Sajdas of Forgetfulness.

A problem in telling his wife or not telling her. Knowing that he does not fast or pray while he knows about his state. Knowing that he did not commit a crime or sin, what is his verdict? Answer: In the Name of Allah the Abundantly Merciful and Intensely Merciful, Praise due to Allah the Lord of the Worlds. The foundling is not judged to be a son of fornication (zina) until he knows that he is a son of fornication (zina) with correct legitimate evidence. And thus, the foundling is considered to be a human whom his father and lineage is unknown and its not allowed for a human to ascribe him to himself; and if he did so it is not correct. Rather, if he was a believer, he is your brother in religion and its obligatory upon the believing society to treat him as someone whose lineage is unknown, not that he is a son of fornication, so whoever treats him as a son of fornication has committed a wrongdoing. As for the situation of this person specifically, he must be urged to pray and fast.

Answer: Ahmed Alhasan (a.s.) said: This amount of alcohol in the drinks or the food has two circumstances: Firstly: That this amount shouldn't be causing intoxication to the human and originally shouldn't be prepared to cause intoxication, and the cause for it to be in the drink happens from: Either, from the way of preparing the drink and food itself; meaning from the exact preparation which causes an amount of alcohol to be in it, without him adding something from the alcohol. Or, from adding it into the drink or food and not happening from the way of preparation itself. And in both of these cases, there is nothing wrong with these drinks and foods and its not considered to be impure and impermissible to drink it or eat it with the existence of this amount of alcohol which does not cause intoxication and not cause drunkenness. Secondly: That the amount of alcohol which is being added is alcohol or wine which is originally prepared to cause intoxication (like how when someone wants to add to the drink or the food, wine from a bottle, which is prepared for intoxication), in this case the drink or the food becomes impure (Najis) and is impermissible to drink it and eat it even if the amount that was added was very small and does not create intoxication.",

So when he goes to sleep every night, protect him with Surat al-Falaq, Surat al-Nas and Ayat al-Kursi, and try to have him read them with you. And as the days pass, he will memorize them. For example, when the child leaves the house and goes to school, teach him to say the remembrance of Allah so that it becomes a habit that he grows into, so whenever he leaves the house, he remembers Allah. And you can have him say only (Ya Allah) [O Allah] whenever he leaves. The remembrance of Allah is not only for the betterment of the hereafter of your child; rather, the remembrance of Allah safeguards your child from the evil of mankind and jinn for you in this world, and from every harm.

A problem in telling his wife or not telling her. Knowing that he does not fast or pray while he knows about his state. Knowing that he did not commit a crime or sin, what is his verdict? Answer: In the Name of Allah the Abundantly Merciful and Intensely Merciful, Praise due to Allah the Lord of the Worlds. The foundling is not judged to be a son of fornication (Zina) until he knows that he is a son of fornication (Zina) with correct legitimate evidence. And thus, the foundling is considered to be a human whom his father and lineage is unknown and its not allowed for a human to ascribe him to himself; and if he did so it is not correct. Rather, if he was a believer, he is your brother in religion and its obligatory upon the believing society to treat him as someone whose lineage is unknown, not that he is a son of fornication, so whoever treats him as a son of fornication has committed a wrongdoing. As for the situation of this person specifically, he must be urged to pray and fast.

What is the limit of the exiting of the woman from her house? Answer: The veil that is known basically is the ju'bah (a long trench coat, wide, and not holding to you, and is not see-through and covers the arms of the woman, and its one piece). The disk of the face is what is allowed to be shown and she must wear a head covering (the bottom part of the chin is not part of the disk, and it is a round thing a disk, not 3 dimensional). Anything that shows which a woman should cover up is against the jurisprudence of Islam, and it is haram. It is incumbent and obligatory upon the woman to wear the hijab the way the Ahlul Bayt (a.s) defined, and an absolute obligation upon a man who has any woman upon his authority, that he enforces the right shariah of the veil. These laws must be enforced upon a woman who has reached puberty or at the age of 9 moon years old (108 months, meaning 9 x 12 months according to the hijra calendar, not the gregorian calendar). The married woman cannot allow someone to come into her house but by the permission of her husband, and she cannot give anything from her house but by the permission of her husband. And she cannot set foot except by the permission of her permanent husband, and this is in regards to the permanent husband and not the mu'tah husband. The disk of the face, it is okay to show. The clothes are not to be ones you can see through or ones that describe the body of the woman, and they must be long. The Abaya is mustahab. The covering of the face is mustahab, but not obligatory.

With thanks and gratitude. Answer: May the peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you. May God welcome you, my beloved Shaykh Arif Al-Khafaji. I clarified previously in more than one answer that there are rules for music and other matters that perhaps will come in the future. What I have previously explained from the rules: act upon it until God makes a judgment, for every command has a reason and a time.

    "text": "What are the specific rulings on major ritual impurity (janabah) and when is ghusl obligatory?\n\nIf someone misses a Friday prayer, obligatory prayer, Tawaf, or writing the Qur'an: If the impurity was due to a major reason (e.g., ejaculation), it is obligatory to perform Ghusl before engaging in any of these acts.\n\nEntering the mosque while in a state of major impurity: For example: If someone is in a state of janabah (major impurity), they are not allowed to enter the mosque unless they perform Ghusl.\n\nReciting or listening to Surahs that are usually recited during condolence gatherings: Surahs like: Yasin, Al-Mulk, Al-Rahman, Al-Najm, and Al-Alaq. If a person has made a vow (nadhr) to enter a mosque or recite specific Surahs during mourning or as a vow, they are obliged to perform Ghusl first — even if the vow is conditional, such as: \"If I recover from this illness, I will enter a specific mosque and recite Surah Yasin.\" In this case, performing Ghusl is obligatory before fulfilling the vow.\n\nIf one delays Ghusl until the time of fasting starts: For example: If someone is in a state of janabah before Fajr and intends to fast (like in Ramadan or a vowed fast), they must perform Ghusl before Fajr time ends. If the Fajr adhan (call to prayer) is at 5:00 AM, and there are only five minutes left, then performing Ghusl must be done quickly. If they do not perform Ghusl in time, their fast is invalid. Note on the use of \"قد (qad)\": It may indicate doubt or indicate that the obligation becomes lighter if the time is tight — but delaying Ghusl intentionally until the end of the time is not acceptable.\n\nIf a menstruating woman uses a cotton pad and there is blood on it: If the blood is light and does not stain the inside, and she wants to fast, her fast is valid without Ghusl immediately. However, if the cotton is soaked in a lot of blood, Ghusl becomes obligatory for her before the fast is valid.",

However, if they found water and still did not perform Tahara (ritual purification) until the prayer time ended, then they are still required to perform Ghusl or Wudu, because the prayer time ended and they had access to water. So in this case, they must still make up the prayer, even though they did Tayammum earlier, because they could've purified themselves before time ran out.\n\nTayammum for someone in a state of major impurity (janabah) inside one of the two sacred mosques — Masjid al-Haram or the Prophet's Mosque: If someone in a state of janabah is inside either the Masjid al-Haram (in Mecca) or the Prophet's Mosque (in Medina), they must leave the mosque — they are not allowed to sit or remain there. If they cannot leave except by using Tayammum, then they must perform Tayammum first and then leave. Even if they leave without Tayammum, it's still considered a sin, and they are accountable. Note: This ruling applies only to men, not to women. Even if a woman is in a state of menstruation and enters one of the two sacred mosques, this rule does not apply to her — she is not required to perform Tayammum before exiting. However, she must leave and should not sit or remain in the mosque.\n\nTayammum when it is only recommended (mustahabb), not obligatory: This includes all scenarios mentioned earlier when Tayammum is recommended but not obligatory, such as: Before Friday prayer (Jumu'ah), Before repentance (Tawbah). It is recommended (mustahabb) to perform Tayammum in these cases, but not obligatory.\n\nWhen Tayammum becomes obligatory due to a vow or oath (nadhr or 'ahd): For example, if someone made a vow or oath (e.g., \"By Allah, I will pray when I reach a certain place\" or \"I vow to offer a specific act of worship when I recover\") — and purification is required for that act — then Tahara becomes obligatory in this case, even if by Tayammum, if water is unavailable.",

The expiation includes freeing a slave, fasting two consecutive months, and feeding sixty poor people. All three are obligatory.\n❖That which obligates fasting after inability to do other works, and they are six:\n2- Unintentional murder and Thehar26. Thehar is forbidden and it requires making expiation if it is made, and the expiation is the same as for unintentional murder. The expiation is freeing a slave, and if he is unable then the expiation is fasting two consecutive months, and if he is unable then feeding sixty poor people is required [as expiation].\n3- Breaking the make up fast after Zawal for a Ramadan missed fast. The expiation is feeding ten poor people, and if he is unable then he must fast three consecutive days.\n4- Making expiation for swearing by Allah over something false. The expiation is freeing a slave or feeding ten poor people or providing them with clothes. If one is unable to do any of the three, then he must fast three days.\n5- Intentionally Leaving Arafat before sunset and the expiation is slaughtering a camel , and if he is unable then he fasts for eighteen days.\n6- Expiation for hunting during pilgrimage. Each individual hunt requires making expiation. Fasting as a form of expiation only occurs if one is unable to other forms of expiation, as clarified in the book of pilgrimage in (The Jurisprudence). It shall be further clarified in the Research of Pilgrimage InshAllah.\n7- The expiation for a man tearing his clothes up (in grief over the death of his wife or son) and the expiation for a woman scratching her face or plucking the hair on her head (in grief over the death of a beloved). It is th same as the expiation for swearing falsely, which is freeing a slave or feeding ten poor people, or providing them with clothes, and if one is unable to do so then he must fast for three days.\n❖The circumstances which give the person the choice of fasting or doing other works in expiation, they are five:\n8- Breaking the fast of Ramadan intentionally. The expiation is freeing a slave or fasting two consecutive months, or feeding sixty poor people.\n9- Breaking a vow or a pledge. The expiation is the same as the previous one [number 8 above], i.e. any of the three choices.\n10-Obligatory Itekaf. The form of expiation is the same as the previous one. A woman shaving her head during calamity (such as death of son, husband etc). The form of expiation is the same as the previous one.\n11-Atonement of a woman shaving her head during grief. As the previous ones.\n12-Shaving one's head during Ehram. The expiation made is slaughtering a sheep or feeding ten poor people one ration each or fasting for three days.)\nThat which obligates fasting when one cannot do a primary work, and he therefore has a choice of fasting or another work, and this is one case:\n13-The expiation for a man who had sexual intercourse with a servant of his who is forbidden to him, and the expiation is (a camel or a cow or a sheep, and if he is unable to do this then he must fast for three days) so in this case, fasting is only obligatory if one is unable to slaughter a cow or a camel or a sheep, and he therefore has the option to either fast or slaughter a sheep.",
