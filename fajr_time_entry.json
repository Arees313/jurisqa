  "text": "When is the time of performing Salat Al-fajr? The timing is between the rise of the second fajr up to sunrise. To clarify what is meant by the first and second fajr: The second fajr (also called the honest fajr) is diffused in the horizon and is connected to it, whereas the first fajr isn't like that; it is raised in the sky and is not connected and diffused in the horizon (it is also called the lying fajr because darkness reoccurs rapidly after it).",
