If the excrement comes out from the small intestines, it does not break ablution. If it comes from the large intestines, it does. 2. If the makhraj (outlet) is not in the usual place and discharges excrement, it breaks ablution. The same rule applies if it becomes a habitual outlet due to injury. 3. Sleep that overtakes the senses invalidates ablution. This includes fainting, madness, intoxication, and minor menstruation (istihādah). 4. Discharge of madhy, wadhy (waddy), or blood — even from the two outlets — does not invalidate ablution, except for the three types of blood: haydh (menstruation), nifās (postnatal bleeding), and istihādah. 5. Vomiting, mucus (nukhamah), nail cutting, hair shaving, or touching private parts, the buttocks, or a strange woman do not invalidate ablution. 6. Eating food touched by fire, or anything exiting the two outlets unless mixed with impurities, does not invalidate ablution.",

Tayammum is obligatory for obligatory prayers if no water is available and for junub in the two mosques (Masjid al-Haram and the Prophet's Mosque) to exit; other cases are recommended. Taharah may also be obligatory through vows (nadhr) and similar cases.",

Any other discharges from the 'two ways' are also exempt.

Obligatory wudu is for obligatory salat, tawaf, or touching Quran under obligatory conditions; recommended wudu is other than these. Obligatory ghusl applies to the same and entering mosque, reciting certain surahs if obligatory. Obligatory tayammum is for prayers when no water is available or for janabah in certain mosques.

        "question": "What are the rulings and conditions regarding Adhan and Iqamah according to Imam Ahmed Alhasan (PBUH)?",
        "answer": "Adhan and Iqamah are obligatory for the five daily obligatory prayers, whether performed late (ada) or as make-up prayers (qadha), and whether prayed singly or in congregation. Women should recite them quietly. Adhan is not valid for Nafila (voluntary) prayers, but the caller says 'Al-Salat' three times. For make-up prayers, Adhan and Iqamah should be done for each prayer, though making Adhan once and Iqamah for the rest is less preferred. On Fridays, Adhan and Iqamah are for Dhuhr, and only Iqamah for Asr. If the imam finishes congregational prayer and others arrive, they should not make Adhan/Iqamah unless the rows disperse. If a person intends to pray alone but joins a group, he should repeat Adhan and Iqamah. The caller (Mu'adhin) must be a sane Muslim male; puberty is not required but maturity (mumayyiz) is recommended. It is recommended he be just, have a pleasant voice, know prayer times, be pure, and stand in a high place. Women's Adhan for women is valid. A person praying alone without Adhan should continue. Mu'adhins receive payment from the treasury if no volunteers are found. Adhan consists of several parts said twice each: Takbir (Allahu Akbar) four times; testimonies of faith and guardianship of Ali and the Imams; calls to prayer and success; concluding with Takbir and Tahlil. Iqamah is similar but shorter, adding 'Qad Qamat As-Salat' twice and Tahlil once. Correct order and recommended etiquettes (facing Qiblah, pauses, deliberate recitation, etc.) apply. Tarji (repeating) in Adhan is disliked except for spreading the call. Saying 'Salat is better than sleep' is forbidden. Rules include: repeating Adhan/Iqamah if one wakes from sleep or fainting; valid Adhan even if caller apostatizes afterward; repeating if apostasy occurs during Adhan; listeners recommended to silently repeat; strong dislike for speech when 'Qad Qamat As-Salat' is said except for managing rows; Mu'adhin must face Qiblah; preference for knowledgeable, pious callers; groups may call Adhan together; imams may accept Adhan from one praying alone; caller must renew Iqamah if ablution is lost; one praying behind an unsuitable imam may call Adhan/Iqamah for himself; and errors by the imam should be corrected by followers.",

        "answer": "Tayamum is not correct before the entrance of time and is valid if time is tight/short. It is not correct if time is ample except in cases of desperation with water purity such as a sick person harmed by water. Obligatory steps include intention, continuing the rule, placing both hands on the ground, wiping the face once, wiping the palms once, and wiping all required parts. If parts of the palms are cut, wiping on the remaining parts or forehead is allowed. Tayamum is correct even if impurity is on the body, and if one purifies with water, time shortness must be considered.",

He should wipe softly with his wet hand over the patch without needing to wet every part of it; wiping over all directions of the patch as much as possible suffices.

        "answer": "Adhan and Iqamah are obligatory for the five daily obligatory prayers, whether performed late (ada) or as make-up prayers (qadha), and whether prayed singly or in congregation. Women should recite them quietly. Adhan is not valid for Nafila (voluntary) prayers, but the caller says 'Al-Salat' three times. For make-up prayers, Adhan and Iqamah should be done for each prayer, though making Adhan once and Iqamah for the rest is less preferred. On Fridays, Adhan and Iqamah are for Dhuhr, and only Iqamah for Asr. If the imam finishes congregational prayer and others arrive, they should not make Adhan/Iqamah unless the rows disperse. If a person intends to pray alone but joins a group, he should repeat Adhan and Iqamah. The caller (Mu'adhin) must be a sane Muslim male; puberty is not required but maturity (mumayyiz) is recommended. It is recommended he be just, have a pleasant voice, know prayer times, be pure, and stand in a high place. Women's Adhan for women is valid. A person praying alone without Adhan should continue. Mu'adhins receive payment from the treasury if no volunteers are found. Adhan consists of several parts said twice each: Takbir (Allahu Akbar) four times; testimonies of faith and guardianship of Ali and the Imams; calls to prayer and success; concluding with Takbir and Tahlil. Iqamah is similar but shorter, adding 'Qad Qamat As-Salat' twice and Tahlil once. Correct order and recommended etiquettes (facing Qiblah, pauses, deliberate recitation, etc.) apply. Tarji (repeating) in Adhan is disliked except for spreading the call. Saying 'Salat is better than sleep' is forbidden. Rules include: repeating Adhan/Iqamah if one wakes from sleep or fainting; valid Adhan even if caller apostatizes afterward; repeating if apostasy occurs during Adhan; listeners recommended to silently repeat; strong dislike for speech when 'Qad Qamat As-Salat' is said except for managing rows; Mu'adhin must face Qiblah; preference for knowledgeable, pious callers; groups may call Adhan together; imams may accept Adhan from one praying alone; caller must renew Iqamah if ablution is lost; one praying behind an unsuitable imam may call Adhan/Iqamah for himself; and errors by the imam should be corrected by followers.",

Women should recite them quietly. Adhan is not valid for Nafila (voluntary) prayers, but the caller says 'Al-Salat' three times. For make-up prayers, Adhan and Iqamah should be done for each prayer, though making Adhan once and Iqamah for the rest is less preferred. On Fridays, Adhan and Iqamah are for Dhuhr, and only Iqamah for Asr. If the imam finishes congregational prayer and others arrive, they should not make Adhan/Iqamah unless the rows disperse. If a person intends to pray alone but joins a group, he should repeat Adhan and Iqamah. The caller (Mu'adhin) must be a sane Muslim male; puberty is not required but maturity (mumayyiz) is recommended. It is recommended he be just, have a pleasant voice, know prayer times, be pure, and stand in a high place. Women's Adhan for women is valid. A person praying alone without Adhan should continue. Mu'adhins receive payment from the treasury if no volunteers are found. Adhan consists of several parts said twice each: Takbir (Allahu Akbar) four times; testimonies of faith and guardianship of Ali and the Imams; calls to prayer and success; concluding with Takbir and Tahlil. Iqamah is similar but shorter, adding 'Qad Qamat As-Salat' twice and Tahlil once. Correct order and recommended etiquettes (facing Qiblah, pauses, deliberate recitation, etc.) apply. Tarji (repeating) in Adhan is disliked except for spreading the call. Saying 'Salat is better than sleep' is forbidden. Rules include: repeating Adhan/Iqamah if one wakes from sleep or fainting; valid Adhan even if caller apostatizes afterward; repeating if apostasy occurs during Adhan; listeners recommended to silently repeat; strong dislike for speech when 'Qad Qamat As-Salat' is said except for managing rows; Mu'adhin must face Qiblah; preference for knowledgeable, pious callers; groups may call Adhan together; imams may accept Adhan from one praying alone; caller must renew Iqamah if ablution is lost; one praying behind an unsuitable imam may call Adhan/Iqamah for himself; and errors by the imam should be corrected by followers.",

If the eyeliner is applied in a natural manner, it is not obligatory to remove it for wudu. This applies even if the eyeliner is inside the eyelid between the upper and lower lids.",

        "question": "What are the rulings and conditions regarding Adhan and Iqamah according to Imam Ahmed Alhasan (PBUH)?",
        "answer": "Adhan and Iqamah are obligatory for the five daily obligatory prayers, whether performed late (ada) or as make-up prayers (qadha), and whether prayed singly or in congregation. Women should recite them quietly. Adhan is not valid for Nafila (voluntary) prayers, but the caller says 'Al-Salat' three times. For make-up prayers, Adhan and Iqamah should be done for each prayer, though making Adhan once and Iqamah for the rest is less preferred. On Fridays, Adhan and Iqamah are for Dhuhr, and only Iqamah for Asr. If the imam finishes congregational prayer and others arrive, they should not make Adhan/Iqamah unless the rows disperse. If a person intends to pray alone but joins a group, he should repeat Adhan and Iqamah. The caller (Mu'adhin) must be a sane Muslim male; puberty is not required but maturity (mumayyiz) is recommended. It is recommended he be just, have a pleasant voice, know prayer times, be pure, and stand in a high place. Women's Adhan for women is valid. A person praying alone without Adhan should continue. Mu'adhins receive payment from the treasury if no volunteers are found. Adhan consists of several parts said twice each: Takbir (Allahu Akbar) four times; testimonies of faith and guardianship of Ali and the Imams; calls to prayer and success; concluding with Takbir and Tahlil. Iqamah is similar but shorter, adding 'Qad Qamat As-Salat' twice and Tahlil once. Correct order and recommended etiquettes (facing Qiblah, pauses, deliberate recitation, etc.) apply. Tarji (repeating) in Adhan is disliked except for spreading the call. Saying 'Salat is better than sleep' is forbidden. Rules include: repeating Adhan/Iqamah if one wakes from sleep or fainting; valid Adhan even if caller apostatizes afterward; repeating if apostasy occurs during Adhan; listeners recommended to silently repeat; strong dislike for speech when 'Qad Qamat As-Salat' is said except for managing rows; Mu'adhin must face Qiblah; preference for knowledgeable, pious callers; groups may call Adhan together; imams may accept Adhan from one praying alone; caller must renew Iqamah if ablution is lost; one praying behind an unsuitable imam may call Adhan/Iqamah for himself; and errors by the imam should be corrected by followers.",

Supplications and prayers before consummation are recommended. The husband should place his hand on the wife's forehead invoking Allah's blessings.

Praise due to Allah the Lord of the Worlds, Prayers of Allah be upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad the Imams and Mahdis Wasalem Tasleema. If Allah chose for you, the khair is what Allah chose, the Exalted. As for the contract may Allah grant you success. You can both complete the contract between each other and allow two witnesses to witness on your behalf or tell a number of people after you completed the contract; like invite some of those who you know for a banquet of food so that some people know about your marriage. And even if you completed the contract in a mosque that is Mukhalef(disagrees with you)in terms of purpose for approval or for some reason. You can redo your seega(statement)of the contract, if there was a certain Khalal(mishap). And the contract is sufficient if she says to you: (Zawajtoka nafsi bi mahr qadraho-katha-wa tathkor almaher) translation:(I made myself marry you by a dowry of this amount:such and such, and mention the dowry) . And there is no need for the existence of a third party to pronounce it; rather, there must be only two witnesses during the contract. If there wasn't this then after the contract make the contract known by telling it to a number of people that you were married with such and such[female], and you can make it known in any way you choose like a banquet at a wedding or publicize it or any form that is suitable for your situation.

        "answer": "It is wajib (obligatory) to use three pieces of cloth for kafan: the mi'zar (a loincloth from navel to knees), the qamis (covers from shoulders to shanks), and the izar (wrapper). In emergencies, one piece suffices. Silk kafan is impermissible. It is wajib to rub camphor on the seven parts of the body that touch the ground during prostration (masaajid), except for a person who dies in ihram, for whom camphor should not be used. The minimum camphor amount is one dirham, better four dirhams, and the ideal 13 and one-third dirhams. Burial without camphor is allowed if necessary. Only camphor and dharirah (fragments of scented cane from India) may be used for perfuming. It is recommended (sunan) that the washer (ghasil) performs ghusl or ablution before shrouding. The deceased should be clothed with an Ibri hibarah (a simple Yemeni dress), a cloth tied tightly around the thighs with cotton placed between the buttocks, and if needed, cotton inserted into the anal opening. A turban is wrapped around the head, its ends brought under the chin and over the chest. For women, additional lafaafa (wrapper) covers the breasts and a namat (woolen striped cloth) covers the body; a qina (head veil) replaces the turban. The kafan should be cotton sprinkled with dharirah on the hibarah, lafaafa, and qamis. Palm leaf stalks (or alternatives such as sidr or khilaf wood) are inserted on the right and left sides of the deceased. The kafan should be sewn with threads from itself, not moistened with saliva. Folding of the wrapper is done left over right and right over left. It is makruh (reprehensible) to use linen kafan, add sleeves, write in black ink on kafan, or place camphor inside ears or eyes.",
